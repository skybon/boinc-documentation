Covering grey spots in BOINC's documentation.

## What it is
This documentation was created because I felt that BOINC's 2 wikies lack some of the crucial information for those who develop BOINC-based projects. Hence pages in this repo will serve as a concise reference for BOINC's grey undocumented areas.

## Contributing
Feel free to open a new pull request with your changes to this documentation.
